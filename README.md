To run this project you will need to navigate to a few folders and run npm start

Firstly run npm i in the root folder 

cd frontend then run npm i

Then you will want to cd ../backend then run npm i

Then cd ../ and npm start (Both the backend and front end should start to run at this time. Backend will run on port 3001 and the front end will run on port 3000)

If you run into any problems with running both the backend and frontend navigate to both directories (/frontend and /backend) and then run npm start
