To run this project you will need to navigate to a few folders and run npm start. Here are the instructions broken down:

1. IN THE ROOT FOLDER
==> npm i

2. cd INTO frontend FOLDER
==> npm i

3. cd ../backend
==> npm i

4. cd ../ (MUST BE IN ROOT FOLDER)
==> npm start
*** Both the backend and front end should start to run at this time. Backend will run on port 3001 and the front end will run on port 3000

****If you run into any problems running both the backend and frontend, navigate to both directories (/frontend and /backend) and then run npm start in each one****
